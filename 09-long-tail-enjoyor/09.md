# a) How, in theory, can you make money based on the SIP specification?
The main profit opportunity here comes from arbitrage between the ETH Wrappr and other markets where sETH is traded. Here's how we could potentially make money:
1. Arbitrage the price difference: 
  - If sETH is trading at a premium on the open market (e.g., Curve), you can mint sETH using the Wrappr contract and sell it at the premium.
  - If sETH is trading at a discount, you can buy sETH cheaply and burn it to receive ETH or WETH.
2. Take advantage of the minting/burning fees: 
  - The contract charges a mintFeeRate and burnFeeRate, both initially set at 5 basis points (0.05%).
  - If the market price difference between ETH and sETH is greater than these fees, there's an arbitrage opportunity.
3. Utilize the maxETH limit: 
  - The initial maxETH is set to 5,000 ETH.
  - Being among the first to utilize this capacity when profitable could lead to gains.

# b) Provide the simulation data when you execute the opportunity using the full maxETH amount.
1. We start with the maxETH amount of 5,000 ETH.
2. In each iteration, we mint sETH using the Wrappr contract, accounting for the mintFeeRate.
3. We then sell the sETH on Curve, accounting for the sETH premium and Curve fee.
4. We calculate the profit, accounting for gas costs.
5. We reduce the sETH premium by 5% each iteration to simulate market impact.
6. We continue until we've used all 5,000 ETH or until the arbitrage is no longer profitable.

```python
import math

# Contract parameters
max_eth = 5000  # Maximum ETH amount allowed in the contract
mint_fee_rate = 0.0005  # 5 basis points
burn_fee_rate = 0.0005  # 5 basis points

# Market conditions
initial_seth_premium = 0.02  # 2% premium on sETH
curve_fee = 0.0004  # 0.04% fee on Curve
gas_cost_eth = 0.05  # Estimated gas cost per transaction in ETH

def simulate_arbitrage(eth_amount, seth_premium):
    # Minting sETH
    seth_minted = eth_amount * (1 - mint_fee_rate)
    fee_pool_susd = eth_amount * mint_fee_rate

    # Selling sETH on Curve
    eth_from_sale = seth_minted * (1 + seth_premium) * (1 - curve_fee)

    # Calculate profit
    profit = eth_from_sale - eth_amount - gas_cost_eth

    return profit, fee_pool_susd

# Simulate the arbitrage
total_profit = 0
total_fee_pool = 0
eth_left = max_eth
iterations = 0

print(f"{'Iteration':^10}|{'ETH Amount':^15}|{'sETH Minted':^15}|{'ETH from Sale':^15}|{'Profit (ETH)':^15}|{'Cumulative Profit':^20}|{'sETH Premium':^15}")
print("-" * 110)

while eth_left > 0 and initial_seth_premium > (mint_fee_rate + burn_fee_rate + curve_fee):
    eth_amount = min(eth_left, 1000)  # Assume we do it in batches of 1000 ETH
    profit, fee_pool_susd = simulate_arbitrage(eth_amount, initial_seth_premium)
    
    total_profit += profit
    total_fee_pool += fee_pool_susd
    eth_left -= eth_amount
    iterations += 1

    print(f"{iterations:^10}|{eth_amount:^15.2f}|{eth_amount*(1-mint_fee_rate):^15.2f}|{eth_amount*(1+initial_seth_premium)*(1-curve_fee):^15.2f}|{profit:^15.2f}|{total_profit:^20.2f}|{initial_seth_premium:^15.4f}")

    # Reduce the premium as we iterate (market impact)
    initial_seth_premium *= 0.95  # Reduce premium by 5% each iteration

print(f"\nTotal profit: {total_profit:.2f} ETH")
print(f"Total fees to pool: {total_fee_pool:.2f} sUSD")
print(f"Number of iterations: {iterations}")
