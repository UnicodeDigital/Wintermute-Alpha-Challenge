# a) You are aware of Jito's modified Solana client to improve the efficiency of MEV extraction. Describe how unaligned validators can run their own private mempool to facilitate sandwich attacks.
Unaligned validators can run their own private mempool to facilitate sandwich attacks by creating a separate, unobservable transaction pool. This allows them to monitor and manipulate transactions before they are included in the public mempool. Here's how they can do it:
1. Private Mempool Setup: The validator sets up a private mempool that is not connected to the public network. This private mempool is only accessible to the validator and their trusted nodes.
2. Transaction Monitoring: The validator monitors the private mempool for transactions that can be exploited for sandwich attacks. These typically involve high-value trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
3. Front-Running and Back-Running: Once a vulnerable transaction is identified, the validator executes a front-running transaction (buying the asset before the victim's transaction) and a back-running transaction (selling the asset after the victim's transaction) to profit from the price movement.
4. Block Production: The validator then includes these transactions in the blocks they produce, ensuring that the sandwich attack is executed before the victim's transaction is processed.

# b) Identify the validators that had their stake removed, and determine the total amount removed.

# c) Write code that, given a Solana block, outputs whether a sandwich attack was included.
