# a) Vulnerability Description and Payoffs for an Attacker
The vulnerability in the old OpenZeppelin implementation of ERC-4626 revolves around the deposit mechanism and how it interacts with the asset's value within the vault. The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform frontrunning attacks by exploiting the predictable behavior of the vault during deposit transactions. Here’s a possible scenario:
- Predictable Deposit Behavior: When a user deposits assets into the ERC-4626 vault, the vault mints shares to the user based on the value of the assets at the moment of deposit.
- Frontrunning Opportunity: If an attacker observes that a large deposit is about to be made (e.g., from a mempool transaction), the attacker can frontrun this deposit by depositing a small amount of assets first.
- Share Inflation: The vault's logic might be such that it mints shares based on the current asset value before the large deposit dilutes the share value. After the large deposit, the attacker's shares represent a disproportionately larger amount of the vault’s assets.
- Withdrawing for Profit: After the large deposit has been processed, the attacker can immediately withdraw their shares, which now represent a larger portion of the vault’s assets, effectively stealing value from the vault.

Payoffs for an Attacker:
- The attacker can potentially extract a large portion of the vault’s assets by manipulating the timing of deposits and withdrawals.
- If unnoticed, this can drain significant value from the vault over time, leading to substantial losses for the vault’s users.
