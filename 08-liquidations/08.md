# a) Whatâ€™s the edge of this liquidator that allows them to win more liquidations?
The key advantage of this liquidator is that they're using a flashloan technique to optimize their liquidations on Compound v2. Specifically, they're using a flash swap from Uniswap v2 to borrow the repayment asset, perform the liquidation, and then repay the flash swap in a single atomic transaction. This method provides several benefits:
1. No need for upfront capital: The liquidator doesn't need to hold large amounts of various assets to perform liquidations.
2. Reduced gas costs: By combining multiple steps into one transaction, they save on overall gas fees.
3. Faster execution: The atomic nature of the transaction allows them to act quickly and beat other liquidators.

# b) When you figure out the source of the edge, you notice that their calldata is extremely obfuscated. Can you explain on how the calldata works?
The calldata for this liquidator's transactions is indeed obfuscated to make it difficult for competitors to understand and replicate their strategy. Here's a high-level explanation of how it likely works:
1. The calldata is encoded in a way that is not easily readable by humans or standard Ethereum explorers.
2. It likely contains multiple nested function calls, including: 
  - A call to Uniswap v2 for the flash swap
  - A call to Compound's liquidation function
  - A call to repay the flash swap
3. The obfuscation might involve custom encoding of parameters, use of proxy contracts, or other techniques to hide the exact details of the transaction.

# c) Write code for the bot in Solidity, and provide all necessary information to simulate this liquidation on a mainnet fork.
This implementation focuses on the core liquidation mechanism:
1. It uses a Uniswap V2 flash swap to obtain the required tokens for liquidation.
2. It performs the liquidation on Compound.
3. It swaps the seized collateral back to the borrowed token.
4. It repays the flash swap and transfers the profit to the contract owner.
