# a) What is the reason for the stale price in this pool?
The stale price in this Uniswap v1 pool is likely due to low liquidity and infrequent trading. Uniswap v1 pools don't have built-in price oracles or mechanisms to automatically adjust to external market prices. They rely solely on arbitrageurs to keep prices in line with the broader market. If arbitrageurs neglect a pool due to low profitability or high gas costs, the price can become stale and deviate significantly from the true market price.

# b) Provide all necessary simulation data to arbitrage the pool on January 23, 2022.
In order to get accurate results for January 23, 2022, we would need to:
- Fetch actual pool reserves: we need to use an Ethereum node or a blockchain explorer API to query the state of the Uniswap v1 pool contract on that specific date. This requires the pool's contract address and the ability to call the getReserves() function for the historical block.
- Use correct market prices: we can obtain historical price data for TUSD and ETH from cryptocurrency data providers like CoinGecko or CryptoCompare. Their APIs allow you to fetch prices for specific dates.
- Consider gas costs: we'd need to look up the average gas price on Ethereum for January 23, 2022. Websites like Etherscan provide historical gas price data.
- Account for slippage and fees: Uniswap v1 had a 0.3% fee on all trades. Slippage would depend on the size of the trade relative to the pool's liquidity.

And this is the example code:
```python
import math

class UniswapV1Pool:
    def __init__(self, eth_reserve, token_reserve):
        self.eth_reserve = eth_reserve
        self.token_reserve = token_reserve
        self.k = eth_reserve * token_reserve
        self.fee = 0.003  # 0.3% fee

    def get_token_output(self, eth_input):
        eth_input_with_fee = eth_input * (1 - self.fee)
        new_eth_reserve = self.eth_reserve + eth_input_with_fee
        new_token_reserve = self.k / new_eth_reserve
        tokens_out = self.token_reserve - new_token_reserve
        return tokens_out

    def get_eth_input(self, token_output):
        new_token_reserve = self.token_reserve - token_output
        new_eth_reserve = self.k / new_token_reserve
        eth_in = (new_eth_reserve - self.eth_reserve) / (1 - self.fee)
        return eth_in

# Simulation parameters (we could replace these with actual values)
eth_reserve = 100  # Example: 100 ETH in the pool
token_reserve = 200000  # Example: 200,000 TUSD in the pool
pool = UniswapV1Pool(eth_reserve, token_reserve)

market_price_tusd = 0.99  # Example: 1 TUSD = $0.99 on Jan 23, 2022
eth_price_usd = 2400  # Example: 1 ETH = $2400 on Jan 23, 2022

gas_price_gwei = 100  # Example: 100 Gwei
gas_limit = 200000  # Estimate for a complex Uniswap trade
gas_cost_eth = (gas_price_gwei * gas_limit) / 1e9  # Convert to ETH

# Calculate arbitrage
max_profit = 0
best_input = 0

for eth_input in range(1, 10001):  # Test inputs from 0.0001 to 1 ETH
    eth_input = eth_input / 10000
    tokens_out = pool.get_token_output(eth_input)
    
    cost_usd = (eth_input + gas_cost_eth) * eth_price_usd
    revenue_usd = tokens_out * market_price_tusd
    profit_usd = revenue_usd - cost_usd
    
    if profit_usd > max_profit:
        max_profit = profit_usd
        best_input = eth_input

print(f"Best ETH input: {best_input:.4f} ETH")
print(f"TUSD received: {pool.get_token_output(best_input):.4f} TUSD")
print(f"Gas cost: {gas_cost_eth:.6f} ETH (${gas_cost_eth * eth_price_usd:.2f})")
print(f"Maximum profit: ${max_profit:.2f}")
print(f"ROI: {(max_profit / ((best_input + gas_cost_eth) * eth_price_usd) * 100):.2f}%")
```

# c) Could you execute the arbitrage on March 14, 2022? If not, explain why.
 It's highly unlikely that this specific arbitrage opportunity would still be available or profitable on March 14, 2022. Even if the pool still existed, it likely had very low liquidity (even 0.01 ETH cannot be confirmed), which could make the arbitrage unprofitable due to high slippage.
