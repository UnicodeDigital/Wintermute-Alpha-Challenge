# b) Produce the code to calculate Jared’s costs and use this to: Compute their profit. Identify the opportunity that yielded the highest single profit.
The attack front-runs the victim by swapping RIO for ETH, adding liquidity to Uniswap V3, and removing liquidity after the victim's swap. The opportunity usually appears when the user trades a large amount with a considerable slippage tolerance.

```python
# Take an attack on Uniswap V3 as example
# Tx 1: Swap RIO for WETH, Add Liquidity
# Tx 2: Remove Liquidity
# Victim tx: 0xe400f802a5d4e2ee4b91be93c3f0bd77a3c50c01bc72a599d9e30515ba9de796

# c) How can you avoid being sandwiched in the future? Provide some reasons that might explain why Jared is out-competing other sandwich enjoyers.
How to avoid:
1. Use Reliable Exchanges: Trade on exchanges with robust security measures and lower susceptibility to front-running attacks.
2. Diversify Trading Patterns: Avoid predictable trading patterns that can be easily exploited by sandwich traders.
3. Use Flashbots: Utilize services like Flashbots to protect your transactions from being front-run.
4. Set a low slippage: Set a low slippage tolerance or specify the amountOutMin will protect your transaction from being exploited

Reasons Why Jared Might Be Out-Competing Other Sandwich Enjoyers:
1. Advanced Tools and Infrastructure: Jared might be using more advanced tools and infrastructure to execute sandwich attacks more efficiently.
2. Better Market Analysis: Jared could have better market analysis capabilities, allowing him to identify profitable opportunities more quickly.
3. Cooperation with Node Operators: It is highly probable that Jared is in cooperation with some large ethereum node operators, who can provide the pending transactions in their mempools for Jared to find opportunities to attack. Moreover, they facilitate sandwich attack by bundling the attack transactions and the victim transaction into the same block, and they enable transactions from Jared to be validated and confirmed faster and cheaper, which is important for attacks like front-running.
