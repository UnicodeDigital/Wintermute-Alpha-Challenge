# a) Are the prices stale according to the view of Compound v1?
Yes, the prices on Compound v1 were potentially stale as of June 5, 2019. Compound v1 relied on a manual process for updating oracle prices, which could lead to outdated price data being used for critical functions like borrowing and liquidations. Although the protocol was officially deprecated on June 3, 2019, the contract was never paused, and there were no functions in place to freeze markets. This situation created a potential vulnerability where stale prices could be exploited to borrow assets cheaply.

# b) Were markets paused in some way? Provide all necessary data to simulate the borrowing of any asset on June 5, 2019 to prove your point.
Despite the deprecation announcement, markets on Compound v1 were not paused, and the protocol continued to operate. As there were no mechanisms to freeze markets, users could still interact with the protocol using potentially stale price data.
To simulate the borrowing of any asset on June 5, 2019, we can consider the following steps:
- Oracle Price Updates: Verify if the oracle prices were updated around that date. Given the manual update process, it's likely that prices were not up-to-date.
- Contract Interaction: Since the contract was not paused, users could still borrow assets by interacting with the borrow function, using whatever price data was available at that time.
- Simulation: To simulate the process, one would need to:
  - Check the oracle prices on June 5, 2019, through historical Ethereum blockchain data.
  - Attempt to simulate a borrow transaction using these prices to calculate the amount of assets that could have been borrowed versus what would be possible with accurate, up-to-date prices.
- Event Data: The subgraph for Compound v1, which tracks events and interactions with the protocol, can provide insights into the transactions that took place around this date, further proving whether or not the markets were being exploited due to stale price data.
